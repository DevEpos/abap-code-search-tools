# abap-code-search
ABAP Advanced Code Search Tools
> **ATTENTION**: This repository is not yet ready to be used

## Description
Searches Code in ABAP sources like
- [ ] Classes (CLAS) 
- [ ] Interfaces (INTF)
- [ ] Programs (PROG)
- [ ] Function Groups (FUGR)
  - Functions (FUGR/F)
  - Function Group Includes (FUGR/I)
- [ ] Data Definitions (DDLS)
- [ ] Access Controls (DCLA)
- [ ] Behavior Definitions (BDEV)
- [ ] Service Definition (SRVD)

The search will be done entirely via ABAP (as opposed to the ADT Source Search). There is an option to run the search in parallel for better performance

There will also be an option to Search-n-Replace coding
> **Note**: This feature will probably not be in the initial release

### Search features
Search can be done via normal String search or with Regular Expressions

### UI
The main focus will be ADT (ABAP Development Tools), but the repository may include some ABAP reports for mere testing purposes
