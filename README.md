ABAP Code Search
> **ATTENTION**: This repository is not yet ready to be used

## Description
Searches Code in ABAP sources like
- [ ] Classes (CLAS) 
- [ ] Interfaces (INTF)
- [ ] Programs (PROG)

  - Function Group Includes (FUGR/I)
- [ ] Data Definitions (DDLS)

Search can be done via normal String search or with Regular Expressions

### UI
The main focus will be ADT (ABAP Development Tools)
